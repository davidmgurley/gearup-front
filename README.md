# **Gear Up (Denver)**

Gear up is a peer-to-peer outdoor / recreational gear sharing service. Colorado is
known for it vibrant outdoor community. Whether it's camping, kayaking, snowboarding, or
mountain biking, Colorado has invigorating outdoor activities for every season. Unfortunately,
acquiring the necessary equipment to participate in these activities can often be prohibitively expensive.
We at Gear Up feel that every person has the right to enjoy to great outdoors of this state. Our application
allows users to post their excess or unused gear for daily rental by those who want to try something new,
or presently do not have the means to purchase recreational equipment.
